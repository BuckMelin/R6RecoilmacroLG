Rainbow six siege recoil macro for logitech

Instructions and how to, As simple as I can make it:
IMPORTANT! There are 15 Steps below, read them carefully before doing anything, and copy & paste with care or it will not work.
TLDR; Put the script at the bottom in your Logitech scripting section.

STEP 1. Open G Hub

STEP 2. Click on 'Active Profile' at the top centre

STEP 3. Click on 'R6'

STEP 4. At the bottom left click on 'PROFILES'

STEP 5. Click inside the box that says 'ADD PROFILE FOR THE SELECTED APP'

STEP 6. Enter a name for this profile, for example 'M4' (as I'll be using the M4A1 Assault Rifle in this example)

STEP 7. You will see this profile appear along the bottom row, at the bottom of the profile you will see the word 'DETAILS' with three icons after it. Click on the first icon (the 
small circular one that looks like a dial)

STEP 8. After a moment the grey bar at the bottom will disappear and you will see a small box with the words 'CREATE A NEW LUA SCRIPT', click it.

STEP 9. Where it says 'NEW SCRIPT' Click on it & name it, you could just call it 'M4' again, press Enter.

STEP 10. Below you will see a blue box with the words 'EDIT SCRIPT'. Click on it.

STEP 11. A box will open. highlight and delete any text that is in there. (*see step 14 below if you want to try a script I made or continue to step 12)

STEP 12a. Copy & Paste any one of Sub2Zero's excellent scripts you desire from the first post on page 1 in this thread into the box.

STEP 12b. In the top left of the box click the word 'SCRIPT' and then click 'SAVE' in the drop down menu

You can leave the box open at this point to test if it is working.

(if you close the box make sure the very last thing you clicked before launching the game was the profile you would like to be active, in this case 'M4')

STEP 13. Launch R6, on any screen in the game, the menu screen for example, hold 'right click' and then hold left click at the same time on your mouse, your mouse cursor should now move down, if it does not, press capslock on your keyboard.

-- /////////// How it works /////////

Numlock turns the script on or off. If you cant get to work, you probably dont have the logitech profile as PERSISTANT. --Dont like the controls? See bottom.

Scrollock toggles between AR guns and SMG style guns. OFF = AR/Strongrecoil. I personally move Scrolllock to the tab key. Goto bottom to see how.

Mouse button (4) will start the rapid fire ONLY if you are holding right click. Only when you lift RIGHT CLICK will it stop rapid fire.

-- //// This script moves the mouse down (x) pixels, then sleeps/delays for (x) number of miliseconds, then repeats
-- //// There are only so many pixels, Changing how many pixels the mouse moves is a broad adjustment
-- //// to REFINE the recoil, you need to adjust the SLEEP Settings, or miliseconds between mouse movements
